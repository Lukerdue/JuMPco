This project was created using creat-react-app.

This project is a side/personal project I'm going to donate to my local youth theatre company when it's finished.
Currently (Jan 2021) I'm a Lambda school student Learning to code.

If you happen to wish to run it you'll need to cd into the folder, run an npm install, and npm start.a
I'll put the link to the finished and deployed site (HERE) when it's finished.

This project was created and made with react, and If i can get around to it there may be a back end involved. We shall see.
